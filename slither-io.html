<title>Slither.io - Unblocked Games 66</title>
<meta content="Slither.io is an online multiplayer game developed by Steve Howse in 2016. It is similar to the classic arcade game, Snake, where players control a snake-like avatar on a two-dimensional plane and the objective is to eat as many pellets as possible to grow in size. However, in Slither.io, players compete against each other in real-time, with the goal of becoming the largest snake on the server.

The game can be played on both desktop and mobile devices and has gained widespread popularity since its release. The gameplay is simple yet addictive, with players able to boost their speed at the cost of losing some of their snake's length. The game features various skins and customization options for players to personalize their avatars." name="description">
